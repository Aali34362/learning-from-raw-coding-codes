The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step-by-step. 
It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction
process can create different representations.

This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with many optional parameters or when 
creating an object involves several construction steps.
The Builder pattern allows you to avoid a constructor with numerous parameters 
(often referred to as the "telescoping constructor" anti-pattern) and provides a fluent interface for creating objects.

When to Use the Builder Pattern?
When you have an object with many optional parameters.
When constructing an object involves a complex configuration or several steps.
When you want to isolate the construction logic from the object's representation.
When you want to make the object immutable and need to ensure that it’s properly initialized.

Real-World Example: Building a Car Object

Imagine you want to build a car object. The car can have different attributes like EngineType, Color, Seats, GPS, and so on. Some of these properties are optional, while others are mandatory. Using the Builder pattern, you can separate the logic of constructing the car and ensure that only valid car objects are created.

Key Concepts in the Builder Pattern

    Builder Interface (ICarBuilder): 
    Defines the steps required to build an object (e.g., SetModel, SetEngine).
    Concrete Builder (CarBuilder): 
    Implements the builder interface, constructing and assembling the parts of the product.
    Product (Car): 
    Represents the complex object under construction.
    Director (Director) (Optional): 
    Encapsulates the construction logic for creating specific configurations.
    Fluent Interface: 
    The builder methods return the builder itself, allowing method chaining.

Benefits of Using the Builder Pattern:
    Readable Code: 
    Provides a clear and fluent API for constructing objects.
    Encapsulation: 
    Isolates complex construction logic from the client.
    Flexibility: 
    Allows for constructing different configurations of the same object.
    Avoids Large Constructors: 
    Reduces the need for large constructors with numerous parameters, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.

Summary:
The Builder Pattern is ideal for creating complex objects step-by-step, especially when dealing with numerous optional parameters. 
This pattern provides a flexible solution that separates the construction logic from the object representation, 
making the code easier to maintain and understand.

---
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern used in software design to construct a complex object step by step. 
It allows the construction of a product in a step-by-step fashion, where the construction process can vary 
based on the type of product being built. 
The pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same 
construction process to create different representations.

Components of the Builder Design Pattern
1. Product
The Product is the complex object that the Builder pattern is responsible for constructing.
It may consist of multiple components or parts, and its structure can vary based on the implementation.
The Product is typically a class with attributes representing the different parts that the Builder constructs.

2. Builder
The Builder is an interface or an abstract class that declares the construction steps for building a complex object.
It typically includes methods for constructing individual parts of the product.
By defining an interface, the Builder allows for the creation of different concrete builders that can produce variations of the product.

3. ConcreteBuilder
ConcreteBuilder classes implement the Builder interface, providing specific implementations for building each part of the product.
Each ConcreteBuilder is tailored to create a specific variation of the product.
It keeps track of the product being constructed and provides methods for setting or constructing each part.

4. Director
The Director is responsible for managing the construction process of the complex object.
It collaborates with a Builder, but it doesn’t know the specific details about how each part of the object is constructed.
It provides a high-level interface for constructing the product and managing the steps needed to create the complex object.

5. Client
The Client is the code that initiates the construction of the complex object.
It creates a Builder object and passes it to the Director to initiate the construction process.
The Client may retrieve the final product from the Builder after construction is complete.
