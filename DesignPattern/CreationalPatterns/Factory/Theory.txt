Factory Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern 
that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Problem
Imagine that you’re creating a logistics management application. 
The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the Truck class.
After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. 
Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.
Adding a new transportation class to the program causes an issue
Adding a new class to the program isn’t that simple if the rest of the code is already coupled to existing classes.
Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the Truck class. 
Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. 
Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, 
you will probably need to make all of these changes again.
As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch 
the app’s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects

Solution
The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls 
(using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. 
Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. 
Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.

The structure of creator classes
Subclasses can alter the class of objects being returned by the factory method.
At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another.
However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.
There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products 
only if these products have a common base class or interface. 
Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.

The structure of the products hierarchy
All products must follow the same interface.
For example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface,
which declares a method called deliver. 
Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. 
The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships.

The structure of the code after applying the factory method pattern
As long as all product classes implement a common interface, you can pass their objects to the client code without breaking it.

The code that uses the factory method (often called the client code) doesn’t
see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. 
The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. 
The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the deliver method, but exactly how it works isn’t important to the client.

Pros and Cons
 You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
 Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
 Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

 The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. 
 The best case scenario is when you’re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.

 When to use Factory Method Design Pattern?
Use Factory Method Design Pattern:
When you want to encapsulate object creation: 
If you have a complex object creation process or if the process may vary based on conditions, 
encapsulating this logic in a factory method can simplify client code and promote reusability.

When you want to decouple client code from concrete classes: 
Using the Factory Method Pattern allows you to create objects through an interface or abstract class, 
abstracting away the specific implementation details of the concrete classes from the client code. This promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to modify or extend the system without impacting existing client code.

When you need to support multiple product variations: 
If your application needs to create different variations of a product or if new types of products 
may be introduced in the future, the Factory Method Pattern provides a flexible way to accommodate 
these variations by defining factory methods for each product type.

When you want to support customization or configuration: 
Factories can be used to encapsulate configuration logic, allowing clients to customize the 
creation process by providing parameters or configuration options to the factory method.

Components of Factory Method Design Pattern
1. Creator
This is an abstract class or an interface that declares the factory method. 
The creator typically contains a method that serves as a factory for creating objects. 
It may also contain other methods that work with the created objects.

2. Concrete Creator
Concrete Creator classes are subclasses of the Creator that implement the factory method to create specific types of objects. 
Each Concrete Creator is responsible for creating a particular product.

3. Product
This is the interface or abstract class for the objects that the factory method creates. 
The Product defines the common interface for all objects that the factory method can create.

4. Concrete Product
Concrete Product classes are the actual objects that the factory method creates. 
Each Concrete Product class implements the Product interface or extends the Product abstract class.

You're right! In this particular implementation, we don't need a separate IDatabaseConnection interface with Connect() and Disconnect() methods. Instead, we directly use the IDatabaseFactory interface to provide an instance of ApplicationDbContext because DbContext already encapsulates the logic for connecting and interacting with the database.
Why We Don’t Need IDatabaseConnection

    Entity Framework Core Integration: DbContext in Entity Framework Core already manages the lifecycle of the database connection. When you create or use DbContext, it opens a connection to the database automatically. Similarly, when the DbContext is disposed, it closes the connection.
    Simplicity: Introducing an extra interface like IDatabaseConnection in this scenario would just duplicate functionality, making the code more complex without adding value.
    Direct Interaction: IDatabaseFactory provides the direct entry point to create and use DbContext instances, so we don’t need an intermediary interface for the connection.

Modified Version without IDatabaseConnection

Here's a simplified view of how the pattern works, focusing on the existing classes:

    IDatabaseFactory Interface:
        Responsible for creating an instance of ApplicationDbContext.
        No need for additional methods like Connect() and Disconnect().

    Concrete Factories (SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory):
        Create and configure the ApplicationDbContext instance using the appropriate connection string and provider.
        No direct connection handling is necessary because DbContext manages it.

Revised Explanation of the Implementation

The existing implementation I provided earlier uses the Factory Pattern for managing DbContext creation and interaction. Here’s a summary of the process:

    Factory Pattern Focus:
        The goal of the factory pattern here is to abstract the creation of DbContext objects for different databases.
        We use IDatabaseFactory to define a common way of creating DbContext instances, and each concrete factory class (e.g., SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory) implements this interface to return the appropriate ApplicationDbContext.

    No Additional Connection Interface:
        Since we directly interact with ApplicationDbContext and use it to perform CRUD operations, an additional connection interface (like IDatabaseConnection) would be redundant.

    DbContext Management:
        DbContext in Entity Framework Core manages its own connection state and lifecycles. When dbContext.Database.Migrate() or dbContext.SaveChanges() is called, DbContext will automatically establish a connection, perform the operation, and then close it as necessary.

Revised Code Overview

With the explanation above, the existing code structure is optimal for managing database interactions using the Factory Pattern. To summarize the key elements:

    Interface: IDatabaseFactory
        Provides the CreateDbContext() method that returns an ApplicationDbContext.

    Concrete Factories: SqlServerFactory and MySqlFactory
        Implement IDatabaseFactory to provide specific configurations for different databases.

    Client Code:
        The client code uses IDatabaseFactory to create an ApplicationDbContext and perform operations like Add, Update, and Delete on the database.

Final Note

If the project involves direct, low-level control of connections (e.g., opening and closing connections manually, handling connection pooling, etc.), we could consider adding an IDatabaseConnection interface. However, for a typical application using Entity Framework Core, managing the DbContext directly is more appropriate and aligns with the best practices of EF Core.


The OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) method in DbContext is typically used to configure the database connection or to set options like logging, lazy loading, or query tracking.

In most scenarios, you do not need to configure anything manually inside OnConfiguring when you’re using dependency injection or if you’re passing options through the constructor (like in the example above). However, if you're not using dependency injection, or if you want to programmatically set up the database connection inside the DbContext class itself, this method is where you would specify those options.

Here's how you can use the OnConfiguring method to configure the database provider and connection string.
Example 1: Setting Up a SQL Server Connection

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;");
    }
}

Explanation:

    !optionsBuilder.IsConfigured: This checks if the optionsBuilder has already been configured. If it has not been configured, then it proceeds to configure it.
    UseSqlServer: Specifies SQL Server as the provider and sets up the connection string.

Example 2: Setting Up a MySQL Connection

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseMySql("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;", ServerVersion.AutoDetect("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;"));
    }
}

Explanation:

    UseMySql: Specifies MySQL as the provider. Notice that ServerVersion.AutoDetect() is used to determine the server version automatically based on the connection string.

Example 3: Using SQLite

If you want to use SQLite, you can configure it like this:

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=TestDB.db");
    }
}

Explanation:

    UseSqlite: Specifies SQLite as the provider with a local file TestDB.db as the database.

Example 4: Logging and Additional Options

You can also enable logging or other options inside the OnConfiguring method:

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        // Configuring SQL Server connection
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;")
                      .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()    // Enables logging of sensitive data
                      .EnableDetailedErrors();         // Enables detailed error messages
    }
}

When to Use OnConfiguring

    Programmatic Configuration: Use OnConfiguring if you want to configure the DbContext programmatically without passing options through the constructor.
    Conditional Configuration: If the configuration might vary based on the context (e.g., different connection strings for development and production), you can put conditional logic in OnConfiguring.

Important Note

    If you're using dependency injection to inject DbContext and configure options externally (e.g., in Startup.cs for an ASP.NET Core application), avoid using OnConfiguring as it could override externally configured options.
    If OnConfiguring is used alongside dependency injection, it's important to include a check like !optionsBuilder.IsConfigured to prevent overwriting already-configured options.

Full Example with OnConfiguring Implementation

csharp

// Contexts/ApplicationDbContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }

        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
            {
                // Configure the database here if options are not already configured
                optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;")
                              .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()    // Optional: log sensitive data like query parameters
                              .EnableDetailedErrors();         // Optional: include detailed error messages
            }
        }
    }
}

Final Thoughts

    If you’re using a pattern where DbContext options are provided through a constructor (like dependency injection), it’s common to leave OnConfiguring empty or use it as a fallback configuration.
    The OnConfiguring method is particularly useful in console applications or scenarios where you don't use dependency injection, making it flexible for configuring the database context programmatically.


------------

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It defines an interface or abstract class for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
Types of Factory Patterns

    Simple Factory: Encapsulates the object creation logic in a separate class or method.
    Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of object that will be created.
    Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

When to Use the Factory Pattern

    When the exact type of the object to be created is not known until runtime.
    When you want to decouple the creation logic from the client code.
    When you need to manage or control the instantiation of classes (e.g., singletons or shared instances).

Example of Factory Method Pattern in C#

Let's consider an example where we create a system that generates different types of vehicles, such as cars and bikes. We'll implement a Factory Method Pattern to define the common interface for creating vehicles.

    Define the Product Interface:

    csharp

public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

Create Concrete Products:

csharp

public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving a car.");
    }
}

public class Bike : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Riding a bike.");
    }
}

Define the Creator Abstract Class: The Creator class declares the factory method, which returns an object of type IVehicle. Subclasses implement this method to create specific vehicle types.

csharp

public abstract class VehicleFactory
{
    public abstract IVehicle CreateVehicle();
}

Create Concrete Factories: Each concrete factory overrides the factory method to instantiate and return a specific type of vehicle.

csharp

public class CarFactory : VehicleFactory
{
    public override IVehicle CreateVehicle()
    {
        return new Car();
    }
}

public class BikeFactory : VehicleFactory
{
    public override IVehicle CreateVehicle()
    {
        return new Bike();
    }
}

Use the Factory in Client Code:

csharp

    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create a car factory
            VehicleFactory carFactory = new CarFactory();
            IVehicle car = carFactory.CreateVehicle();
            car.Drive(); // Output: Driving a car.

            // Create a bike factory
            VehicleFactory bikeFactory = new BikeFactory();
            IVehicle bike = bikeFactory.CreateVehicle();
            bike.Drive(); // Output: Riding a bike.
        }
    }

Explanation

    Product Interface (IVehicle): Declares the interface that all products must implement (Drive() method).
    Concrete Products (Car, Bike): Implements the IVehicle interface and provides their own implementations of the Drive() method.
    Creator Class (VehicleFactory): Declares an abstract factory method (CreateVehicle()) that returns an IVehicle.
    Concrete Factories (CarFactory, BikeFactory): Overrides the factory method to create and return instances of specific products (Car or Bike).

Benefits

    Loose Coupling: The client code is decoupled from the creation logic of the objects. It only interacts with the interface or abstract class.
    Scalability: Adding new vehicle types is easy. You simply create a new factory and product class without modifying existing code.
    Single Responsibility: The creation of objects is handled in the factory classes, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Drawbacks

    Complexity: Adding new classes for each product and its factory can increase complexity, especially when the number of concrete products grows.
    Code Duplication: If factories have similar creation logic, there might be some code duplication.

Real-World Use Cases

    UI Libraries: Creating different UI components such as buttons and windows for different operating systems.
    Logging Libraries: Creating different types of loggers (file logger, database logger, etc.) based on configuration.
    Dependency Injection Containers: Managing the instantiation of services and objects in a loosely coupled manner.

The Factory Method Pattern is a fundamental design pattern that helps you manage object creation flexibly and effectively in many scenarios.

----

Yes, the Factory Pattern is a great fit for creating and managing different types of database connections. Using the Factory Pattern in such scenarios allows you to define a common interface for interacting with different databases, and then create concrete implementations for each database type (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.).
Benefits of Using the Factory Pattern for Database Connections

    Abstraction: Client code interacts with a common interface, without worrying about the underlying database type.
    Flexibility: You can switch databases by simply changing the factory implementation, without modifying the client code.
    Extensibility: Adding support for new databases (e.g., Oracle, SQLite) requires only a new factory and connection implementation, leaving the existing codebase untouched.

Implementation Example in C#

Let’s walk through an example where we implement a factory pattern for creating database connections.

    Define a Common Database Interface: This interface represents the contract that all database connection types should follow.

    csharp

public interface IDatabaseConnection
{
    void Connect();
    void Disconnect();
}

Create Concrete Implementations for Different Databases: Implement the IDatabaseConnection interface for each database type, providing specific connection logic.

csharp

public class MySqlConnection : IDatabaseConnection
{
    public void Connect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Connecting to MySQL Database...");
        // Actual connection logic goes here
    }

    public void Disconnect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Disconnecting from MySQL Database...");
    }
}

public class SqlServerConnection : IDatabaseConnection
{
    public void Connect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Connecting to SQL Server Database...");
        // Actual connection logic goes here
    }

    public void Disconnect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Disconnecting from SQL Server Database...");
    }
}

public class MongoDbConnection : IDatabaseConnection
{
    public void Connect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Connecting to MongoDB Database...");
        // Actual connection logic goes here
    }

    public void Disconnect()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Disconnecting from MongoDB Database...");
    }
}

// You can create more classes like PostgreSQLConnection, OracleConnection, etc.

Define a Factory Interface: Create an interface that declares the factory method for creating database connections.

csharp

public interface IDatabaseFactory
{
    IDatabaseConnection CreateConnection();
}

Create Concrete Factories for Each Database: Each factory will create and return an instance of the specific database connection type.

csharp

public class MySqlConnectionFactory : IDatabaseFactory
{
    public IDatabaseConnection CreateConnection()
    {
        return new MySqlConnection();
    }
}

public class SqlServerConnectionFactory : IDatabaseFactory
{
    public IDatabaseConnection CreateConnection()
    {
        return new SqlServerConnection();
    }
}

public class MongoDbConnectionFactory : IDatabaseFactory
{
    public IDatabaseConnection CreateConnection()
    {
        return new MongoDbConnection();
    }
}

// Additional factories for other databases can be created similarly.

Use the Factory in Client Code: The client code can now choose which database connection to use by selecting the appropriate factory, without needing to know the details of each connection type.

csharp

    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Choose the desired database connection by selecting the factory
            IDatabaseFactory factory = new MySqlConnectionFactory();
            // IDatabaseFactory factory = new SqlServerConnectionFactory();
            // IDatabaseFactory factory = new MongoDbConnectionFactory();

            // Create the connection using the factory
            IDatabaseConnection connection = factory.CreateConnection();
            
            // Use the connection
            connection.Connect();
            connection.Disconnect();
        }
    }

Explanation

    Common Interface (IDatabaseConnection): Defines the contract for all database connections with Connect() and Disconnect() methods.
    Concrete Implementations (MySqlConnection, SqlServerConnection, MongoDbConnection): Each class provides its specific logic for connecting and disconnecting to a particular type of database.
    Factory Interface (IDatabaseFactory): Declares the method CreateConnection() that returns an IDatabaseConnection.
    Concrete Factories (MySqlConnectionFactory, SqlServerConnectionFactory, MongoDbConnectionFactory): Each factory creates and returns an instance of the corresponding database connection class.
    Client Code (Program Class): Chooses a specific factory, uses it to create a database connection, and then uses that connection to perform operations.

Advantages of This Approach

    Single Responsibility Principle: Each factory is responsible for creating only one type of database connection.
    Open/Closed Principle: The system is open for extension but closed for modification. You can add new database connection types without modifying existing code.
    Ease of Testing: You can easily create mock factories and connections for unit testing.

Considerations

    Configuration Management: Consider using a configuration file (e.g., appsettings.json) or dependency injection to choose the factory dynamically based on settings.
    Performance: If connection objects are expensive to create, consider implementing a connection pool or caching mechanism.

The Factory Pattern is a robust solution for managing multiple database connections, making your code modular, extensible, and easy to maintain.

-------

Let's enhance the previous example with a more realistic scenario, including actual database models and a DbContext using Entity Framework Core to interact with relational databases like SQL Server and MySQL.

In this example, we will create a User model and use the Factory Pattern along with Entity Framework Core’s DbContext to establish connections to different databases.
Prerequisites:

    Entity Framework Core: Make sure you have Entity Framework Core installed in your project. You can install it via NuGet:

    bash

dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql

Project Structure: Ensure that your project has the following structure:

mathematica

    /DatabaseFactoryExample
    ├── Models
    │   └── User.cs
    ├── Contexts
    │   └── ApplicationDbContext.cs
    ├── Factories
    │   └── IDatabaseFactory.cs
    │   └── SqlServerFactory.cs
    │   └── MySqlFactory.cs
    └── Program.cs

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Define the User Model

Create a User class inside the Models folder.

csharp

// Models/User.cs
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}

2. Define the ApplicationDbContext Class

Create a ApplicationDbContext class that inherits from DbContext in the Contexts folder. This will serve as our database context for managing entity classes.

csharp

// Contexts/ApplicationDbContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }

        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            // Configuration logic can go here, if needed.
        }
    }
}

3. Define the IDatabaseFactory Interface

Create an interface for the database factories in the Factories folder.

csharp

// Factories/IDatabaseFactory.cs
using DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Factories
{
    public interface IDatabaseFactory
    {
        ApplicationDbContext CreateDbContext();
    }
}

4. Implement Concrete Factories for SQL Server and MySQL

Create factory classes for each database type, which will set up the appropriate connection strings and options.

csharp

// Factories/SqlServerFactory.cs
using DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Factories
{
    public class SqlServerFactory : IDatabaseFactory
    {
        private readonly string _connectionString;

        public SqlServerFactory(string connectionString)
        {
            _connectionString = connectionString;
        }

        public ApplicationDbContext CreateDbContext()
        {
            var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ApplicationDbContext>();
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(_connectionString);
            return new ApplicationDbContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
        }
    }
}

// Factories/MySqlFactory.cs
using DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Factories
{
    public class MySqlFactory : IDatabaseFactory
    {
        private readonly string _connectionString;

        public MySqlFactory(string connectionString)
        {
            _connectionString = connectionString;
        }

        public ApplicationDbContext CreateDbContext()
        {
            var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ApplicationDbContext>();
            optionsBuilder.UseMySql(_connectionString, ServerVersion.AutoDetect(_connectionString));
            return new ApplicationDbContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
        }
    }
}

5. Use the Factory in the Main Program

Implement the Program class to use the factory to connect to the desired database, perform CRUD operations, and interact with the User table.

csharp

// Program.cs
using DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts;
using DatabaseFactoryExample.Factories;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Use the appropriate factory based on your configuration or input.
        IDatabaseFactory factory;

        // For SQL Server
        // Make sure to replace with your actual SQL Server connection string
        factory = new SqlServerFactory("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;");
        
        // For MySQL
        // Uncomment this line and comment out the SqlServerFactory line to use MySQL instead.
        // Make sure to replace with your actual MySQL connection string
        // factory = new MySqlFactory("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;");

        // Create DbContext using the factory
        using var dbContext = factory.CreateDbContext();

        // Apply migrations and create the database if it doesn't exist
        dbContext.Database.Migrate();

        // Perform database operations
        PerformDatabaseOperations(dbContext);
    }

    private static void PerformDatabaseOperations(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        // Add a new user
        var user = new User
        {
            Name = "John Doe",
            Email = "johndoe@example.com"
        };
        dbContext.Users.Add(user);
        dbContext.SaveChanges();

        // Retrieve and display all users
        var users = dbContext.Users.ToList();
        Console.WriteLine("List of Users:");
        foreach (var u in users)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Id: {u.Id}, Name: {u.Name}, Email: {u.Email}");
        }

        // Update the user's email
        user.Email = "john.doe@example.com";
        dbContext.Users.Update(user);
        dbContext.SaveChanges();

        // Delete the user
        dbContext.Users.Remove(user);
        dbContext.SaveChanges();
    }
}

Explanation

    Model (User): Represents a user entity with basic properties such as Id, Name, and Email.
    Database Context (ApplicationDbContext): Manages the Users table using Entity Framework Core.
    Factory Interface (IDatabaseFactory): Declares the CreateDbContext() method for creating a DbContext.
    Concrete Factories (SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory): Provide the logic to configure and create DbContext objects for SQL Server and MySQL databases.
    Program: Uses the chosen factory to create a DbContext and perform CRUD operations on the User table.

Considerations

    Configuration Management: Use appsettings.json or environment variables to dynamically choose the factory or connection strings.
    Dependency Injection: In a larger application, use Dependency Injection to inject the appropriate factory into services or controllers.
    Database-Specific Features: Each database might have unique features (e.g., stored procedures, JSON data types in PostgreSQL). Consider how these will be handled in a generic factory implementation.

This implementation provides a complete, working example of how to use the Factory Pattern to manage different database connections and interactions in a real-world C# application using Entity Framework Core.


-----

You're right! In this particular implementation, we don't need a separate IDatabaseConnection interface with Connect() and Disconnect() methods. Instead, we directly use the IDatabaseFactory interface to provide an instance of ApplicationDbContext because DbContext already encapsulates the logic for connecting and interacting with the database.
Why We Don’t Need IDatabaseConnection

    Entity Framework Core Integration: DbContext in Entity Framework Core already manages the lifecycle of the database connection. When you create or use DbContext, it opens a connection to the database automatically. Similarly, when the DbContext is disposed, it closes the connection.
    Simplicity: Introducing an extra interface like IDatabaseConnection in this scenario would just duplicate functionality, making the code more complex without adding value.
    Direct Interaction: IDatabaseFactory provides the direct entry point to create and use DbContext instances, so we don’t need an intermediary interface for the connection.

Modified Version without IDatabaseConnection

Here's a simplified view of how the pattern works, focusing on the existing classes:

    IDatabaseFactory Interface:
        Responsible for creating an instance of ApplicationDbContext.
        No need for additional methods like Connect() and Disconnect().

    Concrete Factories (SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory):
        Create and configure the ApplicationDbContext instance using the appropriate connection string and provider.
        No direct connection handling is necessary because DbContext manages it.

Revised Explanation of the Implementation

The existing implementation I provided earlier uses the Factory Pattern for managing DbContext creation and interaction. Here’s a summary of the process:

    Factory Pattern Focus:
        The goal of the factory pattern here is to abstract the creation of DbContext objects for different databases.
        We use IDatabaseFactory to define a common way of creating DbContext instances, and each concrete factory class (e.g., SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory) implements this interface to return the appropriate ApplicationDbContext.

    No Additional Connection Interface:
        Since we directly interact with ApplicationDbContext and use it to perform CRUD operations, an additional connection interface (like IDatabaseConnection) would be redundant.

    DbContext Management:
        DbContext in Entity Framework Core manages its own connection state and lifecycles. When dbContext.Database.Migrate() or dbContext.SaveChanges() is called, DbContext will automatically establish a connection, perform the operation, and then close it as necessary.

Revised Code Overview

With the explanation above, the existing code structure is optimal for managing database interactions using the Factory Pattern. To summarize the key elements:

    Interface: IDatabaseFactory
        Provides the CreateDbContext() method that returns an ApplicationDbContext.

    Concrete Factories: SqlServerFactory and MySqlFactory
        Implement IDatabaseFactory to provide specific configurations for different databases.

    Client Code:
        The client code uses IDatabaseFactory to create an ApplicationDbContext and perform operations like Add, Update, and Delete on the database.

Final Note

If the project involves direct, low-level control of connections (e.g., opening and closing connections manually, handling connection pooling, etc.), we could consider adding an IDatabaseConnection interface. However, for a typical application using Entity Framework Core, managing the DbContext directly is more appropriate and aligns with the best practices of EF Core.

-----

The OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) method in DbContext is typically used to configure the database connection or to set options like logging, lazy loading, or query tracking.

In most scenarios, you do not need to configure anything manually inside OnConfiguring when you’re using dependency injection or if you’re passing options through the constructor (like in the example above). However, if you're not using dependency injection, or if you want to programmatically set up the database connection inside the DbContext class itself, this method is where you would specify those options.

Here's how you can use the OnConfiguring method to configure the database provider and connection string.
Example 1: Setting Up a SQL Server Connection

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;");
    }
}

Explanation:

    !optionsBuilder.IsConfigured: This checks if the optionsBuilder has already been configured. If it has not been configured, then it proceeds to configure it.
    UseSqlServer: Specifies SQL Server as the provider and sets up the connection string.

Example 2: Setting Up a MySQL Connection

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseMySql("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;", ServerVersion.AutoDetect("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;"));
    }
}

Explanation:

    UseMySql: Specifies MySQL as the provider. Notice that ServerVersion.AutoDetect() is used to determine the server version automatically based on the connection string.

Example 3: Using SQLite

If you want to use SQLite, you can configure it like this:

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=TestDB.db");
    }
}

Explanation:

    UseSqlite: Specifies SQLite as the provider with a local file TestDB.db as the database.

Example 4: Logging and Additional Options

You can also enable logging or other options inside the OnConfiguring method:

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        // Configuring SQL Server connection
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;")
                      .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()    // Enables logging of sensitive data
                      .EnableDetailedErrors();         // Enables detailed error messages
    }
}

When to Use OnConfiguring

    Programmatic Configuration: Use OnConfiguring if you want to configure the DbContext programmatically without passing options through the constructor.
    Conditional Configuration: If the configuration might vary based on the context (e.g., different connection strings for development and production), you can put conditional logic in OnConfiguring.

Important Note

    If you're using dependency injection to inject DbContext and configure options externally (e.g., in Startup.cs for an ASP.NET Core application), avoid using OnConfiguring as it could override externally configured options.
    If OnConfiguring is used alongside dependency injection, it's important to include a check like !optionsBuilder.IsConfigured to prevent overwriting already-configured options.

Full Example with OnConfiguring Implementation

csharp

// Contexts/ApplicationDbContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }

        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
            {
                // Configure the database here if options are not already configured
                optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;")
                              .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()    // Optional: log sensitive data like query parameters
                              .EnableDetailedErrors();         // Optional: include detailed error messages
            }
        }
    }
}

Final Thoughts

    If you’re using a pattern where DbContext options are provided through a constructor (like dependency injection), it’s common to leave OnConfiguring empty or use it as a fallback configuration.
    The OnConfiguring method is particularly useful in console applications or scenarios where you don't use dependency injection, making it flexible for configuring the database context programmatically.

Lessons from Anton Tokshik:
welcome everybody today we're going to be talking about factory patterns factory pattern abstract factory and factory method generally all factory patterns aim to do one single thing it is to take a creation process of something wherever you have it located just from all those places take it and put it into one single place where you can control how stuff gets created there are different ways to do this for different scenarios today i'm going to give you a couple of examples and generally it shouldn't
matter too much differences between factory and abstract factory and factory method as long as you understand the core concept okay so let's dive in and take a look imagine we have a navigation bar like on the website and then we have a drop down menu all right in both the navigation bar we can have a button and on the drop down menu we can have a button right imagine any application this could be a mobile application this could be a desktop application the point is there the same button is in two places okay so here we have
the situation all right now let's blow it up we have more than just a navigation bar more than just a drop menu we have a hundred thousands of places where this button may be located at the moment we have two default buttons and if we want to change our default button to something else like a red button we would have to you know go ahead and change it everywhere would have to go through a thousand places and change it this is a nightmare this is not what you want to be doing this is for example a standard factory
example we take the process of creation we put it inside a factory which is just going to return a button we no longer need to do this we take the button factory and we just go ahead and create a button now instead of changing it in a thousand places we only need to change it in one place okay we're on it and we got the red button so if you're ever looking or for like a symptom when when do i need to use a factory pattern be it whatever whichever one you want to use of the ones that we're gonna go over it is generally am i
creating something in two places identically if so bring it in one place all right in this case the button is internal we don't need anything from outside controlling how it looks like just keep it in-house doesn't matter usually this could be like a helper method sort of thing in your application okay the simplest thing possible all right 

let's move to the abstract factory okay same scenario navigation bar drop down menu we are rendering these for specifically or an apple phone all right so we take the factory and we
create a button okay so for both of these on the navigation bar in the drop down menu we have an ios button rendered now i do have my apple class already inheriting from ui factory and this is just because i've set up the example like that but imagine we didn't have something like that okay and this was just a button factory okay so what you want to do in order to allow something externally to control how your application looks like for example if a very popular one is dark mode and light mode right it's just two different
color schemes if we could basically have a theme interface and then light mode and dark mode we just basically switch between the two implementations and all elements change colors all right same principle here here we're only confined to the apple example we go ahead and give it an interface now we're no longer confined to just the apple example although we can still use it we can then just go ahead grab the android implementation and put it in there right so this the abstract factory is again we sort of
took everything that we could we segregated it right but because in the factory example it was only used internally and we don't need something externally to control how our application works we keep it in-house now this is where we need to offset or abstract how we want to create these things this concept is also known as dependency inversion this is where we define what we need but the thing that is going to do the actual creation is the thing that is supplied okay so we say that we have a theme this is the
template for the theme and the actual implementations for the themes are all different right and i can have different colors set and they can just be like sort of thrown into onto your color palette with different colors in there and you can pick from them okay so that kind of thing is going on here we're injecting think about injection think about composition dependency inversion okay let's take a look at the factory method now this one was a little bit hard for me to grasp at first because i've never
actually used this consciously all right we will come back and look at the abstract factory and see how factory methods are actually used there although again as i said in the beginning it doesn't matter so much if you exactly know which factory pattern you're using understand if you're just getting getting rid of duplication and giving more structure to your code by making sure the way that you create objects is in in an organized place you're kind of already doing it so in this example we have a navigation
bar we have a drop down menu we run the both and we both we get default button from both of them now we have an abstract element where we have the factory method create button right so it's just an abstract class that we can implement okay so this is going to be quite important we have an abstract thing that we can implement just a method this means we can have multiples of them each individual one of these is a factory method okay we then have the navigation bar and we have the drop down menu these are our building blocks with which
we can organize this thing so uh what can we do further to sort of enhance or basically how do we use our building blocks in this case well here what we can do is we can basically do something like this let's say android navigation bar android drop down line up and then have android in these two places and now we have essentially four objects to pick from and there we go so if you think about it we have added tools to our arsenal and instead of injection we are now using inheritance to enforce the structure of cree
of having a button created for these elements now to kind of break down the difference between inheritance and injection composition and still inheritance right these two areas and when do you want to use which one composition is ultimately flexibility and inheritance is structure you need to balance these two in order to get software if you go full composition you just have a set of random things flying around which you have to put together you basically end up having infinite utility if you have if you go full structure you're rigid you can't
change so generally you want to balance two things together now to come back to the abstract factory example where we are indeed using a factory method in the abstract factory it is on our interface we have a factory method that we want to overwrite right and that's essentially it factor factory method is a factory method if we have multiple factory methods on an abstract factory that is still a factory method a simple factory that just creates something that you just need in your code base as a utility you can
just use that right so hopefully you understand this concept a little better and the different ways that you can basically grab the way that you create things and aggregate it in one place be it with a factory internally with an abstract factory injected externally or in the last example where i showed the use of factory methods where you enforce structure as well as defer or abstract the creation of the thing you need whoa hold up look this is the stuff i used to torture myself on the weekends now it takes time to

Lessons from Chirstoper Okhravi:
it's finally time for the factory pattern if you're not already familiar with this playlist what we're doing is that we're walking through all of the patterns in this book head first design patterns one by one by one so if you're not already subscribed now is a good time to subscribe so that you won't miss the next pattern and by the way this book head first design patterns is a great book if you're new to design patterns because it's very pedagogical it has all these images and all of the
narrative and all that stuff if really just looking for a reference book this is not the book but if you're new to patterns be sure to get this book Link in the description but now Factory pattern so the head first book talks about three versions of the factory pattern one the simple Factory two Factory method and three abstract Factory now in the book They're saying that simple Factory isn't actually a design pattern and I completely agree with this and for that reason we're not actually going to talk about it because
it's not a pattern and well by proxy we'll probably talk about it when we're talking about the factory method pattern because it's sort of an increase in abstraction when you go from the simple Factory to the factory method I I'll try and remind us so we'll see what what that was all about but in other words we'll talk about the factory method and the abstract Factory and in this video I want to talk about the factory method and in the next video we'll talk about the abstract Factory so without further
Ado let's get into the factory method so let's first start with a little bit of narrative why do we need the factory method pattern why do we need a concept called a factory why do we need such a thing as a factory now think about it this way in our code we use a lot of different objects we have classes in object oriented program we have lots of classes and we instantiate objects from these classes and then we use these objects in a bunch of different ways now when we talked about strategy pattern You could argue that what we were doing
is that we were programming by wishful thinking we were saying that when I'm in this particular method let's imagine that I already had a thing that does such and such right instead of instead of saying that let me constru a thing here where I am in the Cod I would say let's assume that I already have such a thing and that I am past that thing via some Constructor or via method essentially dependency injection so the idea of the dependency injection right is you can think of it as programming by
wishful thinking you can think of it as that you put yourself in a situation where you say what if I already had a thing that did this and this and this so that's the way of abstracting away the construction of an object away from the place that use that particular thing but here's the thing at some point in the program that thing that you're passing around has to be constructed if you think about it very concretely the the keyword new you have to new up your class you have to con you have to instantiate your classes at some point
in the program inevitable if we're doing object-oriented programming and we're not just using static methods everywhere which by the way don't do that then we need to instantiate objects somewhere and the question is where do we instantiate them and this is what the factory pattern in general is trying to address it's trying to say when you are about to instantiate Let's encapsulate that instantiation so that we can make it uniform across all places so that you can use the factory whenever you want to
instantiate and the factory is responsible for instantiating appropriately now it might seem a little bit silly to create a wrapper around the keyword new because if the difference is saying new animal or calling create animal on an animal Factory class then it seems like you're just substituting one line for the other and you start to wonder what the benefit is but think about it from these two different perspectives so a it's possible that the instantiation is actually very complex in other words it's it's possible that
in order to instantiate an animal you might need computation you need some kind of business logic in order to determine what parameters you want to pass to this particular animal and maybe which animal you actually want to construct that's on one hand on the second hand so B it's also about polymorphism if you have a Factory that wraps your your construction and if that factory is an instance then you can swap that at runtime you can swap that instance for an instance of another Factory polymorphism let's get into this
in more depth let's let's try to be a little bit more concrete so here's what I'm saying when we're talking about Factory pattern we're saying that in your system you have a bunch of classes so you have a and you have B and you have C and let's assume that these classes all either inherit from some super class or implements some interface let's call it I so in other words A's and B's and C's can be treated as the same type and this is of course I mean I mean dot dot dot like you can have any
number of classes in your system that can be treated as the same type right that follow the same kind of contract doesn't matter what this is right it could be like you have cat and you have dog and you have duck and then this super class is animal so these are a bunch of animals in your system whatever now let's say then that at a particular point in your program you want to instantiate one of these things for some reason in this position in the program you want to be able to use either an A or a b or a c and the point is that upon
entering the place let's say the method upon entering the method in which this line is located you cannot from the outside or you cannot when entering here trivially know which one you want to create if you knew which one you would create this is not a factory method it's not a factory problem then you would simply use for example dependency injection you would just pass in an instance of an a or an instance of a b or an instance of a c if you knew which one you needed but if you don't know which one you need in other words if you
do if you actually he want to construct that thing and going back to what we were saying before point one if when you're about to construct this thing you actually need some kind of logic now what do we mean when we say logic let's say that I'm building a national park simulator I'm building a simulation of like a forest or whatever so so in other words my what my program will do is that will it will spawn ducks and cats and dogs and they they'll jump around and do stuff within this simulation right so it's like we have
some kind of system that pretends to be a park wherein animals live super silly but I mean it doesn't really matter the example doesn't matter the the point is that we want to instantiate these different things and for some reason we need some logic that determines which of these things that we want to instantiate and for example the reason I'm pushing for the the forest the simulation example is that we could say that okay by the way I mean wild dogs and cats in the forest never mind but just follow
along so we could imagine that for example what you would want to do is that you want to flip a coin right you want to randomize something on determinism you want to you want to randomize and then you want to say that either I want to create this thing or I want to create this thing or I want to create this thing by the way if you haven't already notice if you've got the design head first design patterns book I hope you forgive me for completely diverging from the example that they're using so some of the examples in this
book are excellent in my humble subjective opinion and some of these examples are absolutely catastrophical for the factory pattern chapter I just can't for the life of me figure out how they would think that this is an easy to understand example it might just be that it's non- relatable for me because so what they're talking about is that they're talking about different types of pizza so it's like New York style pizza and whatever that other La style pizza or something like this and maybe it's
just that not being from neither New York or La that doesn't really make any sense to me because I'm not intimately familiar with these pizza types if I was maybe that would make perfect sense but to me that's just completely confusing so I'm choosing an example which is extremely different from the example here I hope you don't mind what we will do is that we will look at the definition and we'll look at the uml in this book back to the example in other words we were saying that we randomly
want to create either an A or B or C now you could say that okay well that's silly I mean that's that's a simple piece of logic so you would just put that logic here if the number is such and such create this if the number is such and such create that if the number is such and such create that but you could imagine that this is only one of the places where we're doing this let's say that we had another place where we would also want to use the same kind of logic right where we either create this
or we create this or we create that and imagine that the logic that we're describing here like let's say let's say random creation is only actually one of the kinds of logic we want to use to create these things maybe there are actually other ways which could be for example let's say that we have some kind of balanced creation where we want to use some kind of random creation but maybe we want to maintain an equal number of these at let's say every third time so in other words like we randomly
create either an A or a b or a c and if it happens that we create an a then we only randomize between B's and C's and if it then turns out that we create a b then next time we'll create only a c and so forth and so forth I mean it's just a silly example but what I'm emphasizing is that depending on your scenario depending on what you're building you might have different business logic that determines what thing you want to create what thing you want to instantiate and that logic can be encapsulated can be
built into coded into what we commonly refer to as a factory so this Factory is responsible for for holding for keeping the business logic of creation of creation of something of a particular shared type in this scenario I in the general case or when we using a specific example it would be animal so we have a factory that's responsible for a particular creation mechanism a particular way of constructing animals so if you have two factories then you have two ways of creating animals they both create the same thing they both
create the same thing but they create them in different ways and here are two important points to remember they create them in different ways and I should say and or they create different subtypes so I think we need to get a little bit more concrete so what I'm saying is that we have sort of two things we have the things that we are creating and we have the factories that create these things so let's say that these are the things that we're creating right let's let's use concrete names here so let's say
that this was dog and this was cat and this was duck and this main class is animal sorry for being extremely sloppy I think you can follow along so you have that right these are these are the things that we're creating you you can think of this as the data right we want to create some kind of data we want to build some some kind of value object it doesn't at all have to be a value object but just for the sake of the example it might be more simple to think about it that way so these are the things we're
creating but then on the other hand we have another thing which is the way in which we can create these things let's remove this stuff and let's say that what we can have is for example random creation actually let's call it Factory so we have the random Factory so the random Factory to be explicit we could even call it random animal Factory the random animal Factory creates animals whether at any particular point in time you will get a dog a cat or a duck entirely depends on when we call the random Factory when we call create
animal which is a method that returns an animal when we call create animal get back an animal whether that animal will happen to be a dog or a cat or a duck we don't know it entirely depends on what logic resides in this method and the intent in this example the intent of the random Factory the random animal Factory is that this method will randomly create any of these so let's think about the other let's think about the other creation Factory that we talked about so let's say that we also have something we
call the balanced Factory so again I should have called these like balanced animal Factory and random animal Factory but because this one is called random Factory I'll call this one balanced Factory so the balanced Factory has the same signature in other words it has a method that returns an animal and is called create animal but this one what this one does is that it is that it randomizes one of these the first time you call it so it has some kind of state so so so if you think about this this Factory does not have state because it's
random every time this Factory actually has State the balance between these different things matter so either it uses state from the world or it uses State internally so in other words the first time it's is creating randomly one of these but if at any given time you have more of any one of these then whenever you call create animal then that thing will that that particular animal will be excluded from the randomness I mean again remember that this is only part of the example so in terms of the pattern this doesn't matter
I'm just trying to find some kind of reasonable example of what could be different between these two different things so in this particular case we're making sure that upon every third creation we have an equal number of the three different types of animals where in this one will converge towards the same number so so in this one over time we'll have roughly the same number of of each of the different types but at any point in time it could be that it's skewed towards one or the other again just an example so I was trying to
explain this without uml but but you can see that we're sort of slowly moving towards uml so let's actually introduce some more uml nness so we're saying that we have these two things that are factories and you probably already guessed that because I'm saying that this is a factory and this is a factory then they should share some kind of ancestry they should share some kind of class or interface so let's remove this divider and let's specify that interface so in this particular scenario I would
probably call that an animal Factory and that thing of course has a method that returns an animal and is called create animal and then of course these two classes are of that type in other words they implement the interface in case it's an interface or they are of that type if it's an abstract class or if it's a class in this particular scenario it probably suffice to have as an interface and honestly this is really pretty much it this is really pretty much the factory method pattern let's look at the definition from the head
first book so in head first they say that the factory method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses Let's dig through this the factory method pattern defines an interface remember that now when we're saying interface we're not necessarily meaning interface as in class interface abstract class this kind of thing as in the keyword but we're saying interface in terms of a
contract it defines a a common contract with under which you can refer to this particular thing in other words it could be an interface but it could also be a super class so the factory method pattern defines an interface for creating an object so the key point of factory method pattern the key point of factory pattern is that in the end you want an object you don't necessarily know how you want to construct that object why you want to construct that object and what parameters you want to pass when constructing that object these
are all unknowns and that's why you want to defer this is why you want to let somebody else take that decision so the factory method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate and I would again I would put more into this and just say that it's not only about which class to instantiate it's also about what you actually want to pass to that class that you're instantiating Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to sub classes honestly I'm not entirely sure
what they mean here I'm not sure if they mean that that the common ancestor defers the decision to the subclasses or whether they simply mean that whoever is using the factory defers to these factories but since they're saying subclasses they probably mean that that the animal Factory does not have to make the decision about which of the animal classes to instantiate and what to pass to it when when instantiating but rather these suglasses the random Factory or the balanced Factory these decide which
object to construct and how and that's it so let's now clean up the mess we got on the Whiteboard and let's look at the generalized uml diagram from this book so in this example they use these terms they have a product which in our case was the animal they have a Creator which in our case was the animal Factory the creator creates products the animal Factory creates animals then they have concrete product which in our case were cats dogs and ducks and concrete products are products or implements
products and then the final piece is that they have concrete Creator which in our case was the random Factory or the balanced Factory the random animal Factory and the balanced animal Factory and these of course implements or are creators in our case the random animal Factory was an animal Factory and all animal factories create animals which in this case on the general level is a product and the subass is a these products are actually what is being created by any of these concrete creators so you have a concrete creator
that creates some kind of concrete product but in order for us to be able to use polymorphism we need to be able to treat all of the different concrete creators the same way which is why we make all of the different concrete creators be creators and since they all need to create things that might be different in type they might be able to create dogs or cats or ducks or whatever these things need to share some kind of common interface some kind of common contract and that's why the concrete products we might have many of them are
products or implement the interface product and just to go full circle with the methods here what we also the way they denot is is that they mention that they have a factory method here factory method and of course then a factory method here as well and of course they're not explicitly denoting that in the head first book but of course the super important point is that these Factory methods return something of type product in other words return something that is of type product which in our prev example was animal so just step
back a moment and think about how we've divided different responsibilities between these different classes in other words what do these different classes do what are these actually responsible for so creators are as the name implies concerned with creation of some particular thing of some shared type which in this case is denoted as a product so creators create products but the creators might be abstract or it might be an interface because because the key point is that we want to to use polymorphism ah here's actually a very
good place to talk about the simple Factory non pattern that they mentioned in the book so the simple Factory that they mentioned in the head first book Is essentially this same uml diagram but without the Creator portion without this above upper portion and other words it's a way of having concrete factories probably a single concrete Factory that is responsible for the creation of products so if you just think about that for a moment that's actually a very intuitive idea so it's like whenever we
are in our application at and we find some piece of logic that we repeat and that logic is centered around the creation of objects of some shared type so let's say we did that random thing we randomize a number and then we create one of three types if we realize that we're duplicating that piece of code in many places it's a very intuitive idea to say ah actually let's extract that into its own class and have a method for that and let's just call that method whenever we want to use this piece this
randomizer logic and create one of these three objects and that's fine and dandy it's better than nothing but it's it's not really using the power of polymorphism it's not really it's it's really a very very small step you you could just by introducing a tiny bit more abstraction really gain much more flexibility and that flexibility essentially stem from saying that actually this notion of being able to create something of this shared type is an idea of which I could have multiple
instances the idea of having some kind of uh strategy or some kind of way of constructing a product is something that could could vary and that varying we we can very easily capture with with the factory pattern with a factory method pattern so essentially we're then introducing this Creator we're just saying that when I extracted that logic and put that into a concrete Factory into a concrete Creator then I could very easily say that that is of a type so that I trivially could later create a different Creator if I at a different
point in time want to use some other kind of Creator going back to the discussion of responsibilities so this side over here is is responsible for creation is responsible for how to create something and this side over here is just actually the stuff that we want to create so this is sort of the data that we want to produce and again it's not actually just data so perhaps it makes more sense to think about it as a product but it's this kind of stuff that we want to produce and how we produce that is defined by the factories it's
defined by the creators so that's a lot of repetition I would guess that it's probably clicking now if not please do shoot something in the comment and let's discuss further before we wrap up let me just try to give you a slightly different example that's that's very similar to this but that might provide some context into when we would perhaps want to use this and here it hopefully becomes more obvious why the factory method pattern is actually very powerful and how it gives us a lot of flexibility
that eliminates a lot of potential duplication and potentially saves us a lot of time so let's say that we're building some kind of game and let's say that this game has a number of levels right so you just think about some old arcade game that you've played like the the the the the game where you're a a ship that floats around in space and a sort of asteroids appear like enter the screen then they slowly sort of travel around and you're in this ship and you can use your thrusters to move around in
this space and whenever you shoot one of these asteroids they split into multiple asteroids and you don't want to get hit by asteroids but you get a point you want to avoid any you want to split all of them and collect points and whatever it's probably very easy for you to see how the factory method pattern would apply here you have a factory that produces asteroids the game sort of progresses and as time progresses asteroids are created so you think about it this way so think about that we have a game loop
I haven't been building a lot of games but it's my understanding this is the common way to do it so there's some kind of iteration that goes on uh in the game all the time all of the time and at every tick or at every step at every lap of this game loop we're saying we're calling a factory we have some factory and we're calling that factory and we say create asteroid or just think about how we're sort of moving into something more General we we could even say we could even say create obstacle or
something like that so I'm just implying that you don't necessarily need to have a create asteroids and create powerups and create L you even have them all in in sort of the same method but I mean it depends entirely on your design and what you're actually trying to achieve but let's say that we have let's say that we have create asteroid now that's trivial and I think you can see how what we were doing before applies you call create asteroid maybe you're using some Randomness so you have something like
the random asteroid Factory and which maybe maybe we even only have a single type which is the asteroid it doesn't matter maybe we just have that type and the point is that you have some property in the asteroid which is like the the size of the asteroid so sometimes you get a very large asteroid and sometimes you get a very tiny asteroid because you want to have some kind of dynamic n in the game right and maybe actually also you you would potentially even randomize the the position of the asteroids who
would have the x coordinate and the y coordinate in the asteroid so of course we do that because you don't always want to have the same size asteroid that's B in the same place all the time ET so we randomize the location and we randomize the size of the asteroid right now that's fine and dandy but that's not very complex think about it this way what if then you use a factory in level one and then you use another Factory in level two then you use another Factory in level three and so forth but actually
when I say another it doesn't necessarily mean that we would we would have the level one Factory and we would have the level two Factory lots of different types you can see how that would scale very painfully if either if you have like a lot of levels or if you're actually creating the game that you want to be dynamic instead you can think about it this way what if the factory what if we pass some parameters to the factory and the factory uses those parameters to determine to change some of the logic of of asteroid
creation so we maybe we pass two things we pass the likelihood of the asteroid being big and we pass the so we didn't talk about that parameter before but maybe we could we would have velocity so I mean it needs to start and sort of In Motion so we would have a velocity X and a velocity y for example so maybe we pass another parameter which is the speed in other words let's say that in higher levels we pass a high high speed value and a high likelihood of it being large and in in in the lower levels we
pass a very low value for the speed and a very low likelihood of the asid being large in other words we've suddenly created a very nice set of classes that we can use to dynamically build very easy levels build very easy conditions where we have small asteroids that don't move very fast and at the Hard levels we are able to create large asteroids that move very quickly this is just an example I mean of course you could do this any way you want but I think you're starting to see how in an ocean that's
very similar to the discussion we had around strategy pattern when you find good abstractions when you find good factories and and you parameterize them in good ways you suddenly need fewer types it's like you turn types into properties and I think Factory pattern is sort of a very helpful tool in trying to move away from a sort of class explosion into a world where we have a few key classes where there's a lot of variation that can happen by simply combining them in appropriate ways and instantiating them with different
properties so this is really the point about composition over inheritance so I think you can see that if you keep on pushing on this sort of game example and this sort of asteroid example you can create a few key factories that you can use to create tons of different levels with tons of different behavior and and actually very very interesting behavior and possibly we wouldn't even need to manually instantiate all of these different factories we could simply for example compute the input numbers that we give to these factories based on the
level number that we that we are on if we're at level four level four is a multiplier that we use to to compute the likelihood of the asteroid being large or the speed of the asteroid and then we just instantiate that Factory and then we we suddenly have a level four which we know is more difficult than level than level three but it's less difficult than level five and I think then again you can see easily how we could have the asteroid Factory and we could have the PowerUp Factory and the whatnot Factory
and then we just keep on moving in that direction so we're sort of parameterizing all of the portions of the system which again moves the creation logic out of these particular levels so it's not just that we don't need to have a class for level three and a class for level four it's even that even if we have the same class for all of these that class itself the level class doesn't at all need to be concerned about creation it's just passed a few classes that are factories a few classes that are responsible for
creation and it just calls the appropriate method on these creation classes which we previously called either create animal or create product all right that's it thank you very much for watching if you have any questions or comments or feel that I've misrepresented or want to help other people in trying to understand what this pattern is actually about or when it's useful please do shoot anything in the comments and if you're new to design patterns I highly recommend you to get this book it's in the description and of
