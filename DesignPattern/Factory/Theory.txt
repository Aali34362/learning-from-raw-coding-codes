Factory Pattern

Factory Method is a creational design pattern 
that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Problem
Imagine that you’re creating a logistics management application. 
The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the Truck class.
After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. 
Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.
Adding a new transportation class to the program causes an issue
Adding a new class to the program isn’t that simple if the rest of the code is already coupled to existing classes.
Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the Truck class. 
Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. 
Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, 
you will probably need to make all of these changes again.
As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch 
the app’s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects

Solution
The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls 
(using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. 
Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. 
Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.

The structure of creator classes
Subclasses can alter the class of objects being returned by the factory method.
At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another.
However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.
There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products 
only if these products have a common base class or interface. 
Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.

The structure of the products hierarchy
All products must follow the same interface.
For example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface,
which declares a method called deliver. 
Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. 
The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships.

The structure of the code after applying the factory method pattern
As long as all product classes implement a common interface, you can pass their objects to the client code without breaking it.

The code that uses the factory method (often called the client code) doesn’t
see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. 
The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. 
The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the deliver method, but exactly how it works isn’t important to the client.

Pros and Cons
 You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
 Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
 Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

 The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. 
 The best case scenario is when you’re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.

 When to use Factory Method Design Pattern?
Use Factory Method Design Pattern:
When you want to encapsulate object creation: 
If you have a complex object creation process or if the process may vary based on conditions, 
encapsulating this logic in a factory method can simplify client code and promote reusability.

When you want to decouple client code from concrete classes: 
Using the Factory Method Pattern allows you to create objects through an interface or abstract class, 
abstracting away the specific implementation details of the concrete classes from the client code. This promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to modify or extend the system without impacting existing client code.

When you need to support multiple product variations: 
If your application needs to create different variations of a product or if new types of products 
may be introduced in the future, the Factory Method Pattern provides a flexible way to accommodate 
these variations by defining factory methods for each product type.

When you want to support customization or configuration: 
Factories can be used to encapsulate configuration logic, allowing clients to customize the 
creation process by providing parameters or configuration options to the factory method.

Components of Factory Method Design Pattern
1. Creator
This is an abstract class or an interface that declares the factory method. 
The creator typically contains a method that serves as a factory for creating objects. 
It may also contain other methods that work with the created objects.

2. Concrete Creator
Concrete Creator classes are subclasses of the Creator that implement the factory method to create specific types of objects. 
Each Concrete Creator is responsible for creating a particular product.

3. Product
This is the interface or abstract class for the objects that the factory method creates. 
The Product defines the common interface for all objects that the factory method can create.

4. Concrete Product
Concrete Product classes are the actual objects that the factory method creates. 
Each Concrete Product class implements the Product interface or extends the Product abstract class.















-------------------
welcome everybody today we're going to be talking about factory patterns factory pattern abstract factory and factory method generally all factory patterns aim to do one single thing it is to take a creation process of something wherever you have it located just from all those places take it and put it into one single place where you can control how stuff gets created there are different ways to do this for different scenarios today i'm going to give you a couple of examples and generally it shouldn't
matter too much differences between factory and abstract factory and factory method as long as you understand the core concept okay so let's dive in and take a look imagine we have a navigation bar like on the website and then we have a drop down menu all right in both the navigation bar we can have a button and on the drop down menu we can have a button right imagine any application this could be a mobile application this could be a desktop application the point is there the same button is in two places okay so here we have
the situation all right now let's blow it up we have more than just a navigation bar more than just a drop menu we have a hundred thousands of places where this button may be located at the moment we have two default buttons and if we want to change our default button to something else like a red button we would have to you know go ahead and change it everywhere would have to go through a thousand places and change it this is a nightmare this is not what you want to be doing this is for example a standard factory
example we take the process of creation we put it inside a factory which is just going to return a button we no longer need to do this we take the button factory and we just go ahead and create a button now instead of changing it in a thousand places we only need to change it in one place okay we're on it and we got the red button so if you're ever looking or for like a symptom when when do i need to use a factory pattern be it whatever whichever one you want to use of the ones that we're gonna go over it is generally am i
creating something in two places identically if so bring it in one place all right in this case the button is internal we don't need anything from outside controlling how it looks like just keep it in-house doesn't matter usually this could be like a helper method sort of thing in your application okay the simplest thing possible all right 

let's move to the abstract factory okay same scenario navigation bar drop down menu we are rendering these for specifically or an apple phone all right so we take the factory and we
create a button okay so for both of these on the navigation bar in the drop down menu we have an ios button rendered now i do have my apple class already inheriting from ui factory and this is just because i've set up the example like that but imagine we didn't have something like that okay and this was just a button factory okay so what you want to do in order to allow something externally to control how your application looks like for example if a very popular one is dark mode and light mode right it's just two different
color schemes if we could basically have a theme interface and then light mode and dark mode we just basically switch between the two implementations and all elements change colors all right same principle here here we're only confined to the apple example we go ahead and give it an interface now we're no longer confined to just the apple example although we can still use it we can then just go ahead grab the android implementation and put it in there right so this the abstract factory is again we sort of
took everything that we could we segregated it right but because in the factory example it was only used internally and we don't need something externally to control how our application works we keep it in-house now this is where we need to offset or abstract how we want to create these things this concept is also known as dependency inversion this is where we define what we need but the thing that is going to do the actual creation is the thing that is supplied okay so we say that we have a theme this is the
template for the theme and the actual implementations for the themes are all different right and i can have different colors set and they can just be like sort of thrown into onto your color palette with different colors in there and you can pick from them okay so that kind of thing is going on here we're injecting think about injection think about composition dependency inversion okay let's take a look at the factory method now this one was a little bit hard for me to grasp at first because i've never
actually used this consciously all right we will come back and look at the abstract factory and see how factory methods are actually used there although again as i said in the beginning it doesn't matter so much if you exactly know which factory pattern you're using understand if you're just getting getting rid of duplication and giving more structure to your code by making sure the way that you create objects is in in an organized place you're kind of already doing it so in this example we have a navigation
bar we have a drop down menu we run the both and we both we get default button from both of them now we have an abstract element where we have the factory method create button right so it's just an abstract class that we can implement okay so this is going to be quite important we have an abstract thing that we can implement just a method this means we can have multiples of them each individual one of these is a factory method okay we then have the navigation bar and we have the drop down menu these are our building blocks with which
we can organize this thing so uh what can we do further to sort of enhance or basically how do we use our building blocks in this case well here what we can do is we can basically do something like this let's say android navigation bar android drop down line up and then have android in these two places and now we have essentially four objects to pick from and there we go so if you think about it we have added tools to our arsenal and instead of injection we are now using inheritance to enforce the structure of cree
of having a button created for these elements now to kind of break down the difference between inheritance and injection composition and still inheritance right these two areas and when do you want to use which one composition is ultimately flexibility and inheritance is structure you need to balance these two in order to get software if you go full composition you just have a set of random things flying around which you have to put together you basically end up having infinite utility if you have if you go full structure you're rigid you can't
change so generally you want to balance two things together now to come back to the abstract factory example where we are indeed using a factory method in the abstract factory it is on our interface we have a factory method that we want to overwrite right and that's essentially it factor factory method is a factory method if we have multiple factory methods on an abstract factory that is still a factory method a simple factory that just creates something that you just need in your code base as a utility you can
just use that right so hopefully you understand this concept a little better and the different ways that you can basically grab the way that you create things and aggregate it in one place be it with a factory internally with an abstract factory injected externally or in the last example where i showed the use of factory methods where you enforce structure as well as defer or abstract the creation of the thing you need whoa hold up look this is the stuff i used to torture myself on the weekends now it takes time to
digest this and package it up into these videos so if you did enjoy the content please like subscribe if you want to see more i'll leave a comment if you have any questions and if you want to be part of the community that i'm building make sure to join my discord server i also stream on twitch wednesdays and sundays six six o'clock london time i have also opened up a merch store so if you do want to support me don't just donate buy from there links to all of that and my other social media are in the description hope to see

You're right! In this particular implementation, we don't need a separate IDatabaseConnection interface with Connect() and Disconnect() methods. Instead, we directly use the IDatabaseFactory interface to provide an instance of ApplicationDbContext because DbContext already encapsulates the logic for connecting and interacting with the database.
Why We Don’t Need IDatabaseConnection

    Entity Framework Core Integration: DbContext in Entity Framework Core already manages the lifecycle of the database connection. When you create or use DbContext, it opens a connection to the database automatically. Similarly, when the DbContext is disposed, it closes the connection.
    Simplicity: Introducing an extra interface like IDatabaseConnection in this scenario would just duplicate functionality, making the code more complex without adding value.
    Direct Interaction: IDatabaseFactory provides the direct entry point to create and use DbContext instances, so we don’t need an intermediary interface for the connection.

Modified Version without IDatabaseConnection

Here's a simplified view of how the pattern works, focusing on the existing classes:

    IDatabaseFactory Interface:
        Responsible for creating an instance of ApplicationDbContext.
        No need for additional methods like Connect() and Disconnect().

    Concrete Factories (SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory):
        Create and configure the ApplicationDbContext instance using the appropriate connection string and provider.
        No direct connection handling is necessary because DbContext manages it.

Revised Explanation of the Implementation

The existing implementation I provided earlier uses the Factory Pattern for managing DbContext creation and interaction. Here’s a summary of the process:

    Factory Pattern Focus:
        The goal of the factory pattern here is to abstract the creation of DbContext objects for different databases.
        We use IDatabaseFactory to define a common way of creating DbContext instances, and each concrete factory class (e.g., SqlServerFactory, MySqlFactory) implements this interface to return the appropriate ApplicationDbContext.

    No Additional Connection Interface:
        Since we directly interact with ApplicationDbContext and use it to perform CRUD operations, an additional connection interface (like IDatabaseConnection) would be redundant.

    DbContext Management:
        DbContext in Entity Framework Core manages its own connection state and lifecycles. When dbContext.Database.Migrate() or dbContext.SaveChanges() is called, DbContext will automatically establish a connection, perform the operation, and then close it as necessary.

Revised Code Overview

With the explanation above, the existing code structure is optimal for managing database interactions using the Factory Pattern. To summarize the key elements:

    Interface: IDatabaseFactory
        Provides the CreateDbContext() method that returns an ApplicationDbContext.

    Concrete Factories: SqlServerFactory and MySqlFactory
        Implement IDatabaseFactory to provide specific configurations for different databases.

    Client Code:
        The client code uses IDatabaseFactory to create an ApplicationDbContext and perform operations like Add, Update, and Delete on the database.

Final Note

If the project involves direct, low-level control of connections (e.g., opening and closing connections manually, handling connection pooling, etc.), we could consider adding an IDatabaseConnection interface. However, for a typical application using Entity Framework Core, managing the DbContext directly is more appropriate and aligns with the best practices of EF Core.


The OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) method in DbContext is typically used to configure the database connection or to set options like logging, lazy loading, or query tracking.

In most scenarios, you do not need to configure anything manually inside OnConfiguring when you’re using dependency injection or if you’re passing options through the constructor (like in the example above). However, if you're not using dependency injection, or if you want to programmatically set up the database connection inside the DbContext class itself, this method is where you would specify those options.

Here's how you can use the OnConfiguring method to configure the database provider and connection string.
Example 1: Setting Up a SQL Server Connection

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;");
    }
}

Explanation:

    !optionsBuilder.IsConfigured: This checks if the optionsBuilder has already been configured. If it has not been configured, then it proceeds to configure it.
    UseSqlServer: Specifies SQL Server as the provider and sets up the connection string.

Example 2: Setting Up a MySQL Connection

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseMySql("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;", ServerVersion.AutoDetect("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User=root;Password=your_password;"));
    }
}

Explanation:

    UseMySql: Specifies MySQL as the provider. Notice that ServerVersion.AutoDetect() is used to determine the server version automatically based on the connection string.

Example 3: Using SQLite

If you want to use SQLite, you can configure it like this:

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=TestDB.db");
    }
}

Explanation:

    UseSqlite: Specifies SQLite as the provider with a local file TestDB.db as the database.

Example 4: Logging and Additional Options

You can also enable logging or other options inside the OnConfiguring method:

csharp

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        // Configuring SQL Server connection
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;")
                      .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()    // Enables logging of sensitive data
                      .EnableDetailedErrors();         // Enables detailed error messages
    }
}

When to Use OnConfiguring

    Programmatic Configuration: Use OnConfiguring if you want to configure the DbContext programmatically without passing options through the constructor.
    Conditional Configuration: If the configuration might vary based on the context (e.g., different connection strings for development and production), you can put conditional logic in OnConfiguring.

Important Note

    If you're using dependency injection to inject DbContext and configure options externally (e.g., in Startup.cs for an ASP.NET Core application), avoid using OnConfiguring as it could override externally configured options.
    If OnConfiguring is used alongside dependency injection, it's important to include a check like !optionsBuilder.IsConfigured to prevent overwriting already-configured options.

Full Example with OnConfiguring Implementation

csharp

// Contexts/ApplicationDbContext.cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace DatabaseFactoryExample.Contexts
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }

        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
            {
                // Configure the database here if options are not already configured
                optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=TestDB;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;")
                              .EnableSensitiveDataLogging()    // Optional: log sensitive data like query parameters
                              .EnableDetailedErrors();         // Optional: include detailed error messages
            }
        }
    }
}

Final Thoughts

    If you’re using a pattern where DbContext options are provided through a constructor (like dependency injection), it’s common to leave OnConfiguring empty or use it as a fallback configuration.
    The OnConfiguring method is particularly useful in console applications or scenarios where you don't use dependency injection, making it flexible for configuring the database context programmatically.


------------

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It defines an interface or abstract class for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
Types of Factory Patterns

    Simple Factory: Encapsulates the object creation logic in a separate class or method.
    Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of object that will be created.
    Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

When to Use the Factory Pattern

    When the exact type of the object to be created is not known until runtime.
    When you want to decouple the creation logic from the client code.
    When you need to manage or control the instantiation of classes (e.g., singletons or shared instances).

Example of Factory Method Pattern in C#

Let's consider an example where we create a system that generates different types of vehicles, such as cars and bikes. We'll implement a Factory Method Pattern to define the common interface for creating vehicles.

    Define the Product Interface:

    csharp

public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

Create Concrete Products:

csharp

public class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving a car.");
    }
}

public class Bike : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Riding a bike.");
    }
}

Define the Creator Abstract Class: The Creator class declares the factory method, which returns an object of type IVehicle. Subclasses implement this method to create specific vehicle types.

csharp

public abstract class VehicleFactory
{
    public abstract IVehicle CreateVehicle();
}

Create Concrete Factories: Each concrete factory overrides the factory method to instantiate and return a specific type of vehicle.

csharp

public class CarFactory : VehicleFactory
{
    public override IVehicle CreateVehicle()
    {
        return new Car();
    }
}

public class BikeFactory : VehicleFactory
{
    public override IVehicle CreateVehicle()
    {
        return new Bike();
    }
}

Use the Factory in Client Code:

csharp

    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create a car factory
            VehicleFactory carFactory = new CarFactory();
            IVehicle car = carFactory.CreateVehicle();
            car.Drive(); // Output: Driving a car.

            // Create a bike factory
            VehicleFactory bikeFactory = new BikeFactory();
            IVehicle bike = bikeFactory.CreateVehicle();
            bike.Drive(); // Output: Riding a bike.
        }
    }

Explanation

    Product Interface (IVehicle): Declares the interface that all products must implement (Drive() method).
    Concrete Products (Car, Bike): Implements the IVehicle interface and provides their own implementations of the Drive() method.
    Creator Class (VehicleFactory): Declares an abstract factory method (CreateVehicle()) that returns an IVehicle.
    Concrete Factories (CarFactory, BikeFactory): Overrides the factory method to create and return instances of specific products (Car or Bike).

Benefits

    Loose Coupling: The client code is decoupled from the creation logic of the objects. It only interacts with the interface or abstract class.
    Scalability: Adding new vehicle types is easy. You simply create a new factory and product class without modifying existing code.
    Single Responsibility: The creation of objects is handled in the factory classes, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Drawbacks

    Complexity: Adding new classes for each product and its factory can increase complexity, especially when the number of concrete products grows.
    Code Duplication: If factories have similar creation logic, there might be some code duplication.

Real-World Use Cases

    UI Libraries: Creating different UI components such as buttons and windows for different operating systems.
    Logging Libraries: Creating different types of loggers (file logger, database logger, etc.) based on configuration.
    Dependency Injection Containers: Managing the instantiation of services and objects in a loosely coupled manner.

The Factory Method Pattern is a fundamental design pattern that helps you manage object creation flexibly and effectively in many scenarios.
