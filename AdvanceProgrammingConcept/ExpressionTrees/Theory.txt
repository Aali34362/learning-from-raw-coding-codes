Expression Trees in C# represent code in a tree-like data structure where each node is an expression (e.g., method call, operation, or value). 
These are primarily used for dynamic code generation, querying, and compiling at runtime, especially in frameworks like LINQ.

Key Concepts
Expression Tree Structure: 
Nodes in the tree correspond to expressions like constants, variables, method calls, or arithmetic operations.
Usage: 
Expression trees are heavily used in LINQ providers to translate LINQ queries into SQL or other query languages.
Modifying Code at Runtime: 
You can manipulate expressions dynamically and compile them into executable code.

Common Use Cases:
LINQ Providers: 
Translate C# LINQ queries into SQL or other query languages.
Dynamic Code Generation: 
Create and compile expressions at runtime.
Rule Engines: 
Evaluate complex business rules.
Custom Evaluations: 
Build interpreters for dynamically generated code.
