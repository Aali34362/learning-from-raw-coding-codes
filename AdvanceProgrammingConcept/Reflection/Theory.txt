Reflection in C# is a feature that allows you to inspect and interact with the metadata of types at runtime. 
This includes getting information about assemblies, modules, types, and members 
(such as methods, properties, fields, events, and constructors). 
Reflection provides the ability to dynamically create instances of types, 
invoke methods, and access fields and properties, even if their names are not known until runtime.

Key Concepts of Reflection in C#:
Assembly: 
Reflection allows you to inspect the assembly metadata, which includes information about the types defined in the assembly.

Type: 
You can use reflection to get information about a type, such as its name, namespace, base type, implemented interfaces, and attributes.

Members: 
Reflection can be used to inspect members of a type, including methods, properties, fields, events, constructors, and nested types.

Method Invocation: 
Reflection allows you to invoke methods dynamically. You can call methods on objects without knowing their names at compile time.

Dynamic Object Creation: 
Reflection can be used to create instances of types at runtime without needing to know the type during compile time.

Common Uses of Reflection:
Plugins and Extensibility: Loading and invoking types from external assemblies.
ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers): Mapping database fields to object properties dynamically.
Serialization/Deserialization: Converting objects to and from formats like JSON or XML.
Testing Frameworks: Automatically discovering and running tests.
Code Analysis Tools: Analyzing code to enforce rules or conventions.
