Channels are there to solve concurrency and parallelism problems
Primary problem Channel solve is a producer/consumer problem.
If in your code if something is producing something and other thing has to consume it we need Channels.

Channels in C# are a way to safely and asynchronously pass data between producers and consumers. 
They are part of the System.Threading.Channels namespace and provide a thread-safe mechanism for 
communication between tasks in concurrent programming, especially useful in scenarios where tasks produce data at different rates. 
Channels enable decoupling of the producer and consumer by allowing one task to write to a channel, and another to read from it at its own pace.

Key Concepts of Channels:
Channel Types:
	Bounded Channels: Channels with a fixed capacity. When the channel is full, the producer is blocked until space becomes available.
	Unbounded Channels: Channels with unlimited capacity, where producers can write without being blocked.

Channel Creation: 
Channels are created using the Channel.CreateBounded<T> 
or Channel.CreateUnbounded<T> methods, where T is the type of data the channel will hold.

var boundedChannel = Channel.CreateBounded<int>(capacity: 5);  // bounded channel with capacity 5
var unboundedChannel = Channel.CreateUnbounded<string>();      // unbounded channel

ChannelWriter and ChannelReader:
    ChannelWriter<T>: Allows data to be written into the channel.
    ChannelReader<T>: Allows data to be read from the channel.
	
	Channel<int> channel = Channel.CreateUnbounded<int>();
	ChannelWriter<int> writer = channel.Writer;
	ChannelReader<int> reader = channel.Reader;

Writing to a Channel: 
Writing can be done synchronously or asynchronously using WriteAsync or TryWrite methods.

await writer.WriteAsync(42);  // Asynchronously write to the channel
writer.TryWrite(100);         // Try to synchronously write, returns false if not possible

Reading from a Channel: 
Reading can be done using ReadAsync or TryRead methods.

int item = await reader.ReadAsync();  // Asynchronously read from the channel
bool result = reader.TryRead(out int value);  // Try to synchronously read

Closing a Channel: 
The producer can signal that no more data will be written by calling Complete on the writer.

writer.Complete();  // Closes the channel, no more data will be written

Channel in Producer-Consumer Pattern: 
Channels are commonly used in producer-consumer scenarios where the producer generates data and the consumer processes it.

var channel = Channel.CreateUnbounded<int>();
var writer = channel.Writer;
var reader = channel.Reader;

// Producer
Task.Run(async () => {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        await writer.WriteAsync(i);
        Console.WriteLine($"Produced: {i}");
    }
    writer.Complete();  // Signal that no more items will be written
});

// Consumer
await foreach (var item in reader.ReadAllAsync()) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Consumed: {item}");
}

Use Cases:
    Background Task Processing: 
    Channels can be used to distribute background tasks between multiple consumers.
    
    Task Pipelines: 
    They allow you to create pipelines where data passes through multiple stages, with different tasks processing the data at each stage.
    
    Concurrency Control: 
    They help manage concurrency by decoupling tasks that run at different speeds.
